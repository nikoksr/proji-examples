<h3>This repo will hold templates of classes, files and scripts for proji.</h3>

## WIP

This is a work-in-progress! The structure and integration into [proji](https://github.com/nikoksr/proji) of this repo will most likely change in the near future.

## Structure

-   classes: directory for [class](https://github.com/nikoksr/proji#setting_up_a_class) configurations
-   files: template files
-   scripts: scripts that may be implemented into classes

[More informations.](https://github.com/nikoksr/proji#structure-of-a-class)

## Goals

-   Collect as many different project configurations as possible and make them accessible for everyone
-   Integration into proji. As mentioned in this [issue](https://github.com/nikoksr/proji/issues/63) the goal is to push and pull configurations to and from this repo

## Contribute

For now you can contribute configs, file templates and scripts but since the structure of this repo will most likely change, this is definitely not a stable storage location.
