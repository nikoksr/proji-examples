<h3>This repo will hold examples of classes, files and scripts for proji.</h3>

## WIP

This is a work-in-progress! The structure and integration into [proji](https://github.com/nikoksr/proji) of this repo will most likely change in the near future.

## Structure

-   classes:
    -   class-name:
        -   **files:** template files that belong to the class
        -   **scripts:** shell scripts that belong to the class
        -   **proji-\*.toml:** the actual class config

## Goals

-   Collect as many different project configurations as possible and make them accessible for everyone
-   Serve as a temporary collection for all kinds of proji configs until a better solution is there

## Contribute

Contributions are very welcome! Just take an example from the structure of the existing configs.
